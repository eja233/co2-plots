co2-plots
=========

Plots of carbon dioxide data from various sources made during my internship. Includes an automatic plotter, which is a GUI where you input parameters for a plot and it outputs the graph; a simple timeplot comparing two data series; a contour plot of CO2 levels, altitude, and latitude; and a basemap plot of carbon dioxide at different world locations.
